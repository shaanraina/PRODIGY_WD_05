Weather application

Explanation

HTML: The HTML structure includes an input field for the user to enter a location, a button to fetch the weather, and several elements to display the weather information.

Added an additional <p> element for "Feels Like" and "Pressure" in the weather info section.

CSS: Basic styling to make the app look clean and centered on the page.

Added a gradient background to the body.

Enhanced the container with more padding, a larger border-radius, and a stronger box-shadow.

Styled the weather info text to be more visually appealing.

Added a hover effect to the button.

Hid the .weather-info section by default and displayed it only when data is loaded.

JavaScript: The JavaScript code fetches the weather data from OpenWeatherMap API based on the user input and displays the relevant information.

Added more weather data points such as "Feels Like" and "Pressure".

Displayed the .weather-info section only after successfully fetching and displaying the data.
